Yes there are many times when we need their support but they didn't understand. .. it's OK if u don't support but at least try to understand coz if parents will not then who will understand us

As a parent how should we tackle an aggressive child. If child is short tampered.

"on one side, we talk of people's welfare
talk about taking enough of care
but the displaced person live miserably in refugee campus
with broken confidence and trust

such things look very much dangerous
and threaten a human race
we have no face to save
but still, behave as the chief advocate of humanity"

Jyadatar  parents apne bachchon ke saath aisa hi.Karte hai... Jaisa Aapne kaha hai.. Lekin Nahi karna chahiye ...aur apne bachchon se jhooth Nahi Bolna chahiye... Kiyoki Wo Hamari nakal karte hai..
Hello. Yes most of the parents are like this but the main point is that we do not accept it but we do it  I am very thankful on behalf of all parents for this explanation which will really help us to bring up our children. And will maintain a good family relationships thank you may god bless you
